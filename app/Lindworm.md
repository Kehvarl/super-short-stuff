* Snake as a 2d upscrolling platformer.

You can only climb up as high as the length of your snake.  So you need to eat food or power ups to get to the top of the level.

Screen size in tiles: 80x45

Snake can climb straight up as long as 2 body segments remain on the ground

Snake can climb diagonally up as long as more on ground than in air

Without input, a snake head in the air will move down

If head is supported, snake will not fall any further than already fallen

Snake head encountering snake body can't move

Snake head encountering other solid object or surface can't move

Some power-ups allow passage through a solid object

Some power-ups make the body of the snake damage enemies

Each body segment has HP

Enemies will try to damage body segments and shrink snake

Head eats enemies and gains XP

Head eats food and grows snake

Dead enemy becomes food or power-up

Snake = Caterpillar?  Maybe Lindworm.

Enemy types?

Exit at top of level
